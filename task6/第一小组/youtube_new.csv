Hiring managers use behavioral interview questions to help determine if candidates have the skills or experience to do the job.\n\nThe best way to answer these types of questions is to structure your answers using the Experience, Learn, and Grow model. \n\nExperience + Learn = Grow. \n\n- Explain your experience. Share a situation you dealt with in the past. What was the problem or challenge that had to be overcome? \n\n- Talk about how you overcame it and how you accomplished it.\n\n- Explain how you’re going to take this lesson and use it to keep growing as professional so you can add even more value in similar situations in the future. \n\nHere are some common behavioral interview questions you could get asked in your next interview:\n\n - What's your greatest accomplishment on the job?\n\n- Tell me about a difficult situation you encountered and how you overcame it.\n\n- If I was to ask a co-worker about you, how would they describe you on-the-job?\n\n- If someone came to you with an enthusiastic, yet unrealistic request, how would you handle it?\n\nTake these three questions and start practicing structuring your answers using the Experience, Learn, and Grow method. \n\n__________________________________\n\nIf you’re having a hard time even getting interviews, check out our free resource that could help address some issues that could be holding you back. \n"", '\n\nAnd, if you want J.T. and her team to help you become a pro at interviewing, negotiating and more, then you need to check out our Premium Subscription: \n', '\n\nFollow Work It Daily:\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n\n', ' ', ' ",2018年2月7日发布,6:15,"531,805 次观看","""10,704""","""210""",[Work],[3 Things Hiring Managers Want To Know About You],/watch?v=RTvYvZ9VHDc,"397,423"

O'Donnell shares her secrets for acing group interviews (every single time).\n\nCompanies conduct group interviews because they are an efficient way for hiring teams to talk with candidates. Instead of having candidates come in for multiple interviews with different people, they can meet with everyone who has a stake in the hiring process at once.\n\nThis shortens the process for everyone involved because, once you leave, the team can discuss their thoughts on the spot and decide whether or not you’re a fit. \n\nWhile this interview strategy works well for companies, it can be stressful for you as a candidate. That’s why I’m going to share a few tips that will help you navigate these group interviews. \n\n#1. Answer Questions\n\n#2. Ask For Input\n\n#3. Articulate What You Hear\n\n#4. Apply What You Hear\n\nDuring a group interview, or any interview really, you don’t want to just sit there, answering questions. \n\nInstead, you need to engage with the group, get them talking, and create a healthy dialogue.

If you’re asked these questions, it’s best to be prepared so you don’t get flustered during the interview.\n\nHere’s the reality...\n\nYou’re going to have to make a tough decision if you get asked an illegal interview question, which is A) not answer it and call the interviewer out, or B) answer it even though it’s not appropriate.\n\nIf you’re asked an interview question that’s blatantly illegal, you can always say something like, “You know, I’m not comfortable answering that question because it’s technically an illegal interview question. Can we move on from that and go on to the next question?”\n\nHowever, this approach will pretty much guarantee that you won’t get the job, so be careful. Unless you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, it’s usually best to avoid this approach. \n\nIf you suspect that the interviewer simply doesn’t know any better or would like to give him or her the benefit of the doubt, you can do the following instead:\n\nAsk it’s relevant to the job.\n\nIf you’re asked an illegal interview question, you can subtly stand your ground by asking why it’s relevant to the job. \n\nYou can say something like, “I’d be happy to answer your question, but I’m not sure how it relates to the job. Would you care to explain so I can answer it as best as possible?” \n\nThat way, your interviewer has the opportunity to explain his or her reasoning behind the question or move away from it if he or she realizes that it’s illegal.\n\nKeep your it short and sweet.\n\nIf you’re asked an illegal interview question, keep your response short and to the point. Avoid giving away too many details, if possible. The more details you provide, the higher chance they will be used against you.\n\nRead between the lines.\n\nIf an interviewer is asking questions about your personal and family life like, “Do you have any children?” it could be that your interviewer is just inexperienced and trying to make small talk. However, it could also be that the interviewer is trying to judge your priorities and commitment to your work. \n\nIf he or she is worried that you’ll have to have a special schedule that allows you to pick up the kids from school or juggle other personal responsibilities, questions like this might pop up.\n\nIf you’re asked something like this, read between the lines and figure out what the interviewer is really trying to find out. If you sense he or she is concerned about your commitment to the job, frame your response accordingly.\n\nFor example, you could say something like, “Yes, I do have two children. However, I can assure you that my obligations outside of work will not interfere with my commitment to the job.”\n\nDealing with illegal interview questions is never easy. However, it’s best to be prepared so you can handle the situation with a level head.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFree Tutorial: ', ""\n\nIf you want J.T.

Here are some interview questions you want to avoid during initial job interviews:\n\n1. “How much does this job pay?”\n\nWhile this is something everyone needs to know, it’s not something you want to bring up in your first interview. The purpose of the initial interview is to get to know you as a professional, see how you can handle common situations related to the job, and see if you’re a good fit.\n\nMoney is kind of like the elephant in the room during the first interview. Everyone is thinking about it, but no one is talking about it because it’s irrelevant at this point in the hiring process. Don’t bring it up until they do.\n\n2. “What do your benefits look like?”\n\nAgain, this isn’t relevant at this point in the hiring process. The last thing you want to convey is that you only care about the perks of the job. They want to know you’re excited about the opportunity itself.\n\nIf you’re only it for the money and benefits, employers might worry that you’ll leave their company in an instant if you got another offer with better perks and salary. So, why would they waste their time and money on you to begin with?\n\n3. “How quickly can I get promoted?”\n\nYou don’t even have the job yet and you’re already asking how fast you can get promoted? While you might think this question makes you look like a go-getter, the interview might think otherwise. You’re only in the initial stages of the hiring process and you haven’t proved your abilities to the company yet. So for some employers, it would seem ridiculous to estimate how fast you’d be promoted. You haven’t even gotten a job offer yet!\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nWant to hear all 8 ways you are being shut out of the hiring process?

What do you do? Salary negotiations can be TOUGH, but they don't have to be awkward! If you're not sure how to ask for the salary you deserve, use these salary negotiation tips from career expert Ariella Coombs.\n\nPeople have this preconceived notion that talking about money is always going to be awkward. The good news is that it doesn’t have to be.\n\nThe key is being prepared. Not being prepared is usually what makes this an awkward conversation for people.\n\nSo, let me walk you through some tips to help you avoid an awkward conversation about salary.\n\n#1- Always be prepared.\n\nYou never know when an employer will bring up the salary question - it could be in the job application or it could be during your final interview. \n\nThat’s why you want to be prepared for it. Know your numbers BEFORE you apply for the position so you’re not caught off guard. \n\n#2 - Don’t bring it up during the first interview.\n\nBring up salary too soon is a common mistake people make during the hiring process. This can hurt your chances of getting the job offer because the employer might think you’re only in it for the money. Wait until the employers bring it up, or until a little later in the hiring process when things are getting more serious.\n\n#3 - Know what’s competitive.\n\nThese are where doing your homework comes into play. Knowing the competitive salary rate for the role you’re applying to is going to help you negotiate for a fair offer down the line. \n\nIf you don’t have an idea of what’s competitive, you risk asking for too much or too little. So, use websites like Glassdoor.com, Payscale.com, or Salary.com to research competitive salary rates for similar positions. \n\n#4 - Know your “walk away” rate\n\nAfter you do your research, you’ll have an idea of the highest and lowest salaries for similar roles in your field. This is an important thing to know because it will allow you to have a range to work with during negotiations. \n\nWhen working out your range, it’s important to know your “walk away” rate. Basically, this is the absolute lowest offer you can accept financially. \n\nIn most cases, you don’t want to take an offer that’s not going to pay you enough to live comfortably. Otherwise, you’ll probably find yourself back on the job search within six months looking for a higher paying job because you can’t pay your bills.\n\nYou don’t want to price yourself out of the job or sell yourself short, so it’s REALLY important to understand your walk away rate. \n\n#5 - Don’t limit yourself to money. \n\nWhile you should aim to get a competitive salary, don’t focus only on the money. You can negotiate for other things too, like work-from-home opportunities, flex-time, vacation days, and other perks. It depends on what’s most important to you. This will give you some wiggle room during negotiations. \n\n#6 - Give them a reason to give you more. \n\nIn order to get the salary you want, you need to prove that you’ll be a valuable asset to the company and that your skill sets and experience make you the best fit for the role. You need to show them that you’re worth the investment. So, make a case for why you deserve the money you’re asking for and why you’ll be a valuable asset to the company.\n\n#7 - Don’t be afraid of “no”\n\nDuring salary negotiations, it’s okay to say “no” to a job offer if it’s not in line with what you feel is appropriate based on your research and needs. Remember saying no opens up negotiations. \n\n#8 - Relax!\n\nYes, salary negotiations can be stressful. However, it’s a big part of the hiring process. Don’t forgo the negotiations because you’re afraid. \n\nDo your research and go in prepared to get what you deserve. If you’re still nervous, find a friend to practice with. The more your practice, the more comfortable you’ll be when it comes time for the real thing. \n_____________________\n\nIf you’re having a hard time even getting interviews, check out our free resource that could help address some issues that could be holding you back. \n"", '\n\nAnd, if you want J.T. and her team to help you become a pro at interviewing, negotiating and more, then you need to check out our Premium Subscription: \n', '\n\nFollow Work It Daily:\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n\n', ' ', '  ",2018年2月8日发布,4:01,"20,267 次观看","""319""","""3""",[Craig],[How to Start A Job Offer Negotiation WITHOUT LOSING MONEY - 5 Steps!],/watch?v=HrLfOBoAhu0,"49,556"

Free Job Search Resource: \n', '\n\nWant help creating the perfect personal brand? Check out our new class The Ultimate Guide To Personal Branding: ', '\n\nOkay, here are some secrets that will help make your online brand more inviting to employers:\n\n1. Distill your brand down to 2-3 sentences.\n\nIf you want to captivate recruiters, you need to make it very easy for them to see your value. Avoid getting too fancy and wordy in your branding, especially when it comes to your website, social media accounts, or LinkedIn profile. Instead, focus on answering these three questions:\n\n1. Who are you? \n2. What do you do? \n3. How do you do it?\n\nHere’s an example of a three-sentence branding statement:\n\nMy name is J.T. O’Donnell. I’m a career coach who helps turn frustration into career success using a combination of online courses and virtual coaching.\n\nDo you see how easy it is to understand who I am and where I can add value? Keeping it simple, yet specific is key. Recruiters and employers don’t have a ton of time to spare when it comes to researching candidates. So, you want to make it as easy as possible to see your potential value. Craft your own three-sentence branding statement and include it on your website, social media accounts, LinkedIn summary, and so on.\n\n2. Understand your workplace personas.\n\nEmployers judge you on the follow criteria:\n\nPersonality\nAptitude\nExperience\n\nEvery job requires a different type of person. While your skills and experience are an important factor when it comes to earning a job, you also have to think about your personality and capability of doing the job. That’s why it’s CRITICAL to understand your workplace persona.\n\nYour workplace persona is a combination of your personality and aptitude to do the job. To find out what your personas are, take our free, 20 question Career Decoder quiz. You can take the quiz here: ', '. It only takes a few minutes, and it will give you TONS of insight into your unique value.\n\nUnderstanding your top workplace personas can help you market yourself to employers. For example, if one of your workplace personas is a Builder, (someone who enjoys executing on a plan, managing all aspects, keeping it on time, and under budget) emphasize it on your LinkedIn profile by showcasing projects you Developed, Built, Managed, and so on. \n\nEmphasizing these types of accomplishments will help you show employers you have the right workplace persona to do the job. \n\n3. List strategic accomplishments on your LinkedIn profile.\n\nInstead of listing your tasks and responsibilities for each role you’ve held in the past, focus on the RESULTS you’ve achieved. Not only does this prove that you have the skills needed to do the job, but it also proves that you can get results using those skills.\n\nSo, list quantifiable accomplishments under each role. That means, include numbers wherever possible.\n\nExample:\n\nDeveloped email marketing strategies for 20+ clients with lists between 2000 and 10,000 email subscribers.\n\nSo, if you want employers to get a clear sense of how you can add value, you need to be SUPER clear with your language. If you can articulate your value through your online brand, you’ll increase your chances of getting called in for a job interview.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFree Tutorial: ', '\n\nIf you want J.T. and her team to help you become a pro at interviewing, negotiating and more, then you need to check out our career support platform.\n\nWant to learn more about our affordable Premium Subscription?\nLearn more here: ', '\n\nFollow Work It Daily:\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n\n', ' ', ' ",2018年3月6日发布,5:00,"11,370 次观看","""207""","""4""",[Work],[How To Conduct A Long Distance Job Search],/watch?v=cD_7P9gxrX8,"9,413"

If your team is not getting self-organized, maybe you need to look within. There may be something in your behavior which is stopping the team from moving towards self-organization.\n\nMaybe you don't allow them to take their own decisions, maybe there are too much dependent on you for everything. The self-discipline and self-organization is not a one-time event, it's a continuous evolution.\n\nHere are few points which can help\nVisual indicators - YOu can add some visual indicators which improve the transparency within your team. You can add burn down charts, Kanban boards, and other visual elements which are indicators of performance and transparency\n\nBehavior triggers - While promoting good behavior, you would also need to look at the behavior which triggers the opposite, talk to team members who create impediments in the self-organization. Work for creating an environment of trust and transparency.\n\nEffectiveness of retrospectives - Retrospectives are another way of reflecting upon what you did and how you can possibly improve it in the future. Self-discipline is not an overnight improvement, you need to keep working in this direction. Make sure you follow up on the action items decided in a retrospective meeting and ensure the implementation.\n\nCreate an environment of trust - You need to build trust within the team before bringing the transparency. If there is office politics, side talks, gossips, etc, it will reduce your chances of creating a transparent team.\n\nMaking the work fun - You also need to make the work an enjoyable activity for your team members. Try to reduce the unnecessary work pressure, unrealistic deadlines, and fears. The more they enjoy the work, the better will be the output.\n\n"", ' ', ' ",2018年3月9日发布,5:39,"7,751 次观看","""47""","""0""",[tvN],[[티비냥] 상상도 못한 골뱅이 방청객ㅋㅋㅋ 개그맨 씹어먹는 방청객에 양세형 개당황 ㅋㅋ 선배. 솔직히 말해요. 방청객 아니죠. ㄴㅇㄱ | #코미디빅리그 | 151213 #01],/watch?v=u1P-liswvYU,"1,620,437"

You exchange information. You need to have the right responses to the employer’s questions. You need to ask good questions. You need the right background. You need to impress.\n\n1. It’s about their future, not your past.\n\nYou need to get the interviewers, the most senior interviewers, thinking into the future. If you can't get them to imagine what their life will be like and what their company will look like with you there, you'll never get hired.\n\n2. Leaders are inclusive and inspiring.\n\nYou need to be the high tide that lifts all the boats. Leaders build more leaders. They don't build more followers.\n\nYou need to show them you're great at inspiring and inclusive. You're great at building teams.\n\n\n3. Stay away from one-and-done questions because then you’ll be done.\n\nSpecifically, I mean asking a great question, then receiving their response, and then moving on to the next question. That's the big mistake!\n\nThe message you're sending to them is that you are a puddle skipper. You are not somebody who's digging deep to get information and collecting it all. You're not well researched. You’re not digging deep enough to get the information you need to make a good decision.\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

In doing so, they expend so much energy in the interview focusing on their experience before they know which parts of their experience and qualifications the employer is most interested in. At this point, you must be thinking whaaaaaa?\n\nThe Obvious\n\nYou are in a job interview of some kind. The employer, through its action of spending time to speak with you, thinks you’re qualified—on paper.\n\nThe Not-So-Obvious\n\nYou actually get a job interview because of your qualifications. You get the job for three reasons, none of which are your qualifications.\n\nWhy Do You Get the Job?\n\nBased on my observation from thousands of interviews between my clients (the hiring companies) and job candidates (prospective employees), I've concluded a candidate's attainment of the job is largely contingent on three often-undetectable success factors:\n\n• The candidate's ability to effectively articulate his or her qualifications and potential contributions (encoding)\n• The interviewer's ability to accurately interpret the candidate's qualifications (decoding)\n• The interviewer's capacity to remember the candidate (memory)\n\nIt all comes down to your ability to communicate how your qualifications match what the employer needs.\n\nThe 3-Step Fix\n\n1. Keep the three reasons why you get hired in mind. Awareness and consciousness (of these issues) is key to success. Of course, general consciousness is too. ☺\n\n2. When asked an interview question, don’t rush to share your awesomeness unless you know which part of your awesomeness the interviewer and employer needs to know. (That is, it doesn’t matter if you’re fantastic. You need to connect the dots for the employer how your fabulousness matches what it needs!) Sometimes the job interviewer’s question is specific and he or she identifies clearly what’s needed. Other times, the interviewer is vague. Make sure to look before you leap.\n\n3. Ask a clarifying question (if need be) to zone in on exactly what information the interviewer needs to know to determine whether you are a great fit. This is especially helpful in the wake of the dreaded and horribly ineffective, “Please tell me about yourself,” question.

Based on the direction of the company, what do you think will be your greatest accomplishments in the next three years?\n\nOrganizations need to be able to think at least three to five years into the future. But, you don't want to join an organization that only thinks about the future. Thinking is nice, but companies that act and build things and have clarity around specifically what they're going to do are worthy of you. Join them.\n\nIt's a great question because it helps you understand whether they have a vision and if they have clarity regarding specifically what they want to build.\n\nQuestions two, three, and four are about you and your role…\n\n2. What are the qualities of people who are most successful in this position?\n\nYou're looking for the traits the employer wants. The reason it’s a great question is you’ll get the actual traits they’re evaluating and you can use that insight immediately to highlight how you and your background and experience match those traits! Plus, it’s a great setup question for the next one.\n\n3. If you were to give me an offer and I was to accept it, one year from now, what will I have done specifically that you would consider this hire to be a raging success?\n\nIt gives you clarity to make sure you could actually achieve those objectives. And, it gives you ammunition to use within that interview or subsequent interviews to talk about exactly how you’ll accomplish what they consider a success.\n\nYou now know their (year-end) goal is. Get them to envision you completing it for them.\n\nBoom. This one wins the interview even though you’re not done yet. Let’s pile on a bit…\n\n4. If you were to give me an offer and I was to accept it, within one week of starting this job, what will be my biggest surprise?\n\nThis is a little safety net for you. You want to make sure you're uncovering information you might not have uncovered with the questions you've designed.\n\nIt gets the interviewer thinking hmmm, what might this person not ask in the job interview I could share or what surprised me when I first started with the company?\n\n5. What's your management style and what are your expectations of the position you might not have already mentioned?\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

You get the job for three reasons, none of which are your qualifications.\n\nWhy do you get the job? Based on my observation from thousands of interviews between my clients (the hiring companies) and job candidates (prospective employees), I've concluded a candidate's attainment of the job is largely contingent on three often-undetectable success factors:\n\n- The candidate's ability to effectively articulate his or her qualifications and potential contributions (encoding)\n- The interviewer's ability to accurately interpret the candidate's qualifications (decoding)\n- The interviewer's capacity to remember the candidate (memory)\n\nThe reality is you have a greater chance of failing the interview because of a misrepresentation or misinterpretation than you do a lack of qualification.\n\nAction: After you review the video, think about your previous interviews (or exchanges with coworkers) and consider where you had these communication breakdowns. What could you have done differently?\n\nUp Next! In the next lesson, How to Tell Great Stories, I'll help you overcome these communication gaps. You'll learn the five key characteristics of every great story that makes you likeable, believable, and memorable to the employer. See you in a day or so!\n\n--------------------\nABOUT TIPS FOR WORK AND LIFE®\n--------------------\n\nTips for Work and Life® is a weekly careers, hiring, and motivational show full of helpful job search strategies, career management and acceleration tactics, recruitment techniques, and self-help aids with the award-winning author, career coach, and trainer Andrew LaCivita.

Superfluous information hinders their ability to remember.\nCapture and Keep Their Attention. They can't remember you if they're not listening.\nTalk in Their Lingo. Speak in a language they understand.\nMake Them Believe You. Use details to make yourself believable.\nGet Them to Care. Highlight the benefit to the individual in addition to the company.\n\nKeep It Short and Simple\n\nYour goal is to highlight the most necessary information your interviewer seeks without including superfluous remarks. \nCapture and Keep Their Attention\n\nThere are two main issues here. The first difficult obstacle is you cannot make the interviewer pay attention. You need to attract his or her attention. Once you get that attention, you need to keep it.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is by telling stories where you did something first (or it was, at least, your first) and when you did something wrong. (There's much more explanation in the video.)\n\nTalk in Their Lingo\n\nThis is one of the most difficult things for people to do when they're communicating. Do you know why? Because as we evolve through life, we forget what it's like not to know what we know. Make sure you know what language the interviewer speaks or ask them if you're not sure.\n\nMake Them Believe You\n\nTelling stories that are believable is probably one of the easier obstacles you need to overcome. The reason is if you truly lived the event you're sharing, you have the specific details that will help them believe you lived it.\n\nThe easiest way to tell believable stories is to interject details and use statistics if appropriate. \n\nGet Them to Care\n\nWhile believability might be easy to attain, getting them to care might be more difficult. This is true for two reasons. First and foremost, you will not be her top priority at that moment. So how do you get them to care?\n\nThe easiest way to get the interviewer to care is to show her how hiring you benefits her (or something she cares about).\n\nIf you are interviewing with a superior, for example, you might indicate that if you were hired, your skills are strong enough to help relieve her of some of her daily duties so she can focus on more strategic areas. \n\nWhen speaking with a peer, show how you could serve as another resource to share ideas and cross-train each other on your complementary skills. \n\nTo a subordinate, you could highlight the areas in which you can teach or mentor her and your desire to present her with challenging opportunities for growth. These are just a few examples to get you thinking about the possibilities. \n\n"", '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n",2017年1月14日发布,16:43,"83,967 次观看","""1,380""","""50""",[Andrew],[Job Interview Protips: Avoid these Assumptions and Mistakes],/watch?v=GtuqKbIhGwY,"24,660"

Join career expert, motivator, and award-winning author Andrew LaCivita as he discusses how to write a thank you that gets you hired.\n\nThere are typically four challenges:\n\n1) How to thank the employer\n\n2) When to thank the employer\n\n3) What to say in the thank-you\n\n4) What medium to use (handwritten, email).\n\nThere are two most important aspects of the thanking process.\n\nThere are two keys you need to know about thanking somebody to make it effective: speed and thoughtfulness.\n\nSpeed is how quickly you respond to them after your interview. I recommend 24 hours.\n\nThoughtfulness is the level of effort and care you put into the words you place into the thank-you. What messages are you're sending?\n\nYou realize three benefits when you thank the employer.\n\nThere are three benefits of writing a thank-you.\n\n1) You Get To Thank Them: Whenever you’re preparing your thank-you note, you should open with thank you so much for your time and I really enjoyed meeting you.\n\n2) You Get To Sell Yourself: Right after you thank them, add your own unique identifier. Put in your sales pitch. Reinforce why you're the best candidate for the job and why you’re such a great fit.\n\n3) You Get To Reassure the Employer You’re Interested: The third benefit is to reassure the employer of your enthusiasm and interest in the position.\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

SIGN UP HERE: ', '\n\n--------------------\nSUMMARY\n--------------------\n\nIt’s a winner…not.\n\nSure. It wins the dumbest question ever. This question is probably the absolute worst job interview question an employer can ask.\n\nI have more than a decade\'s worth of statistical and predictive models that confirm your cultural fit, achievements, capabilities, skillsets, and strengths are what matters. (See my gold-award-winning book The Hiring Prophecies: Psychology behind Recruiting Successful Employees.)\n\nDo Not as in never…\n\nI can\'t control what the employers ask you. You can\'t control them either. But, I can help you prepare the best answers to this ludicrous question and you can control your response.\n\nDo not—I repeat—DO NOT under any circumstance actually provide them a with a weakness. Never cite something you’re actually bad at. As in N-E-V-E-R.\n\nIf they\'re going to ask you this silly question, you don\'t need to justify it with an actual weakness.\n\nDo not, and this might be contrary to what you’ve heard from other so-called experts, trainers, columnists or whoever, never provide them with a “strength!”\n\nIt\'s insulting enough they\'ve asked you this question. Don’t compound the problem by insulting them back with, oh I don’t know, something like you’re too detail-oriented, too conscientious, work too much, work too hard, or do everything yourself because you don\'t know how to delegate.\n\nHow idiotic do you think these people are? Oh. Wait. They asked this question in the first place. Well, be above that.\n\nDo not use negative words such as “I’m bad at this” or “I’m not good at that” and so on.\n\nDo this instead…\n\nThe best way to handle this question, so that you\'re actually answering it and they view you as giving it the college try, is to cite something you’ve yet to have the opportunity to do.\n\nSay something such as, “One of my areas for improvement is [insert whatever here]. I’ve yet to have the opportunity to perform this function, work in this industry, study these things., etc.”\n\nThey likely won’t penalize you for not having this experience, especially if it’s not germane to the job function.\n\nThen make sure to…\n\nAt the end of your statement, make sure to add what you’ve done and are doing to gain experience in that area.\n\n""…Even though I don’t have practical experience in that area, I’ve read [these] books, watched [these] videos, taken [these] training classes, and so on.”\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

It’s also the most important part of getting the information you need to make a great decision about whether the employer is a good for you.\n\nThere are a lot of questions you need to ask and several areas you need to investigate. Is the company a good company? Is it solid in general? Is it a good company for you?\n\nEven though the company is a good company doesn’t mean it’s a good company for you! There are a lot of questions that go along with trying to figure this out.\n\nWhen you ask your questions, you should keep these three goals in mind. Every question should be designed to:\n\nSell yourself\nGet the information you need\nGet the information as quickly as possible\nThe faster you get the information the more time you have to get more information. The more information you have the more informed the decision. The more informed the decision, the better the decision. (Whew! That’s a lot of mores!)\n\nA question is never just a question\n\nThere is a whole lot that goes into asking your questions, how to organize them, when to use the information and so on. I have an entire free webcast that covers these called 3 Keys to Ace Any Job Interview. See below for details. Go ahead and sign up. I dare ya.\n\nYou can protect yourself with your questions\n\nOne other aspect I’d like to add regarding why I think this is such a valuable question is it helps you overcome one of the biggest reasons you don’t get hired.\n\nA month or so ago, I shot a video and made a blog post titled The Number 1 Reason Why You Do Not Get Hired. The number one reason you don\'t get hired is not because you lack qualifications. Chances are very good if you\'re interviewing you’re qualified.\n\nIt\'s the job candidates’ inability to map how their qualifications align to what the employer needs. Keep that in mind because there is a great chance you can made that misstep in the interview.\n\nWhat is the question already?\n\nThe reason I think this question is a valuable one is because it helps you sell yourself, gets you great information quickly, AND helps you overcome that great obstacle in getting hired.\n\nSo, here it is…\n\n“If you were to give me a job offer and I was to accept it, after one year on the job, what would you consider a success? What would success look like to you? Specifically, what will I have accomplished you would consider to be a success?""\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

When you’re in that job interview, you need to be able to justify your higher wages. But, in the job interview, compensation is really not the issue. \n\nThere are three mental hurdles, barriers, biases, or whatever you want to call them that are typically present in those interviewers. Let’s review those and I’ll teach you how to overcome them.\n\nThe biases…\n\nThe interviewer is more likely thinking your skills are stale or you're set in your ways or you don't want to learn anything new. These biases are much more prevalent obstacles for you.\n\nThe 3 tactics because all good things come in 3s…\n\nYou can overcome those biases with your energy, currency, and attitude.\n\n1. Your vibrancy: Emit a thousand watts.\n\nWhen you walk in the (interview) room, you need to be emitting positive, good energy. You are a light bulb! Emit those thousand watts.\n\nFor some of you more low key types, you might need to do some jumping jacks before you get in the room. Do whatever you need to do to get that energy going. Smile. Smile for real. Just make sure you're bringing it.\n\n2. Your responses to their job interview questions: Be current.\n\nWhen responding to their questions, your examples and experience needs to be current—as in the techniques and tools you use. Use examples that are current.\n\n3. Your awesome attitude: Be overt and share your interest in learning new techniques.\n\nMake sure you outwardly express your interest and excitement for learning new stuff.  You crave new tactics, new methods, and want to be on the current edge.\n\n--------------------\nABOUT ANDREW\n--------------------\n\nAndrew LaCivita is an internationally recognized executive recruiter, award-winning author, trainer, and founder and chief executive officer of milewalk and the milewalk Academy.

LOL.\n\n3 important aspects about asking questions during your job interview:\n\n- The way you organize all your questions.\n- The way you structure each particular question.\n- When you use the information you gather.\n\n2 important goals in asking your questions:\n\n- Sell yourself (yes, really sell yourself)\n- Gather all the intelligence you need to make a great career decision. \n\n1 most important part about your question-asking period:\n\n- You own it! You get to say and ask anything you want!\n\nOrganize all your questions. Maintain a prearranged flow of information and send positive, subliminal messages to the job interviewer by organizing your questions into one of four buckets:\n\nCompany: Aimed at surfacing corporate-level information.\nRole: Related the job position and career development. \nBoss: Regarding your potential boss\'s style, expectations, etc. \nInterviewer: Related to the particular interviewer\'s interest, attraction to company, etc.\nStructure each question. Keep selling yourself while you\'re asking questions!\n\nStructure several (not all) of your questions as follows and you\'ll sell yourself in the process, point the interviewer in the exact direction you want him or her to respond, and get the information you need in the shortest amount of time without misunderstandings.\n\nCandidate\'s Structured Question: ""I was reviewing [insert reference material here--could be from the employer\'s website, public reports, magazine articles, TV, etc.] and noticed [insert relevant astute observation here]. I\'d like to know [insert well thought out question here]. The reason I\'d like to understand that is [insert specific rationale here].""\n\nWhen to use the information you receive. You can use it NOW (short-term) or LATER (long-term). NOW questions yield information you can use during the interview or subsequent interviews to sell yourself. LATER questions yield information you can contemplate at your leisure.\n\n--------------------\nABOUT TIPS FOR WORK AND LIFE®\n--------------------\n\nTips for Work and Life® is a weekly careers, hiring, and motivational show full of helpful job search strategies, career management and acceleration tactics, recruitment techniques, and self-help aids with the award-winning author, career coach, and trainer Andrew LaCivita.

Do you have difficulty coming up with a great response? Join career expert, motivator, and award-winning author Andrew LaCivita as he discusses the best answer to the job hopper question!\n\nLet’s first address what’s happening when an interviewer asks you these questions.\n\nRealize no one is smart enough to take your responses from those particular questions and determine whether you’ll be a great employee in their company. It\'s just too great a leap to connect those dots.\n\nDecisions you made years ago simply won’t help them understand how you\'re going to fit into their organization.\n\nWhat’s the question you’re really being asked?\n\nThe question they are truly asking is, “Why will it be different this time?”\n\nThe interviewer wants to know why are you going to make a good decision that sticks…so when you join their company you’ll be a good longstanding, successful employee.\n\nThat’s what they really want to know. That’s what they want to be assured of.\n\nThat’s the question you need to answer!\n\nTurn multiple job hops into one issue you’ve resolved!\n\nFirst, take responsibility and own your previous actions.\n\nSecond, turn “several” problems into one problem you can address quickly. That is, if you’ve had a handful of job hops, respond to all of them at once. Make it a universal issue you’ve now fixed. You can diffuse it all in one fell swoop.\n\nThird, give your response with a smile and lots of positivity regarding why this will work going forward.\n\nThe answer…\n\n“Ya know, you’re right. I do have a few (or a number of) job hops in my history.\n\nI discovered very recently the reason I was having some trouble was due to a common issue. I wasn’t clear upfront regarding all the criteria I needed to be fulfilled in my job.\n\nI did some self-reflection and thought deeply about everything I needed to make me happy in my work life. I hadn’t done that previously. But, now, I took the time. Performed the exercises and reflected.\n\nThis has put me in a much better position to evaluate whether any future job opportunity and company will be a great fit for me because I now have a much more complete list of the criteria I need. I have that clarity.\n\nPreviously, I wasn’t as skilled at getting the information I need from the employer, but I’m in a much better position now because I’ve gone through this reflection.\n\nI understand specifically what I need to evaluate and how to evaluate it. Now, I’m more confident I can determine whether your company is a good one for me.”\n\nWhy this works…\n\nFirst, you avoid the risk of dragging the conversation on by trying to take one job hop at a time.\n\nWhen you do this, the interviewer thinks goodness. It\'s always something with her. It seems like a different issue every time or he\'s just like Pig Pen. He\'s got that cloud of rain over himself wherever he goes.\n\nYou’ve also shifted a negative question into a positive action you’ve taken!\n\nI realize people leave jobs for countless reasons. You could have an illness in the family. Your husband or wife could be getting transferred.\n\nBut, if you\'re getting asked the job hopper question, the interviewer is looking for the common pattern.\n\nTake responsibility. Defuse it all at once. Speak positively about the action you\'ve taken to overcome it and why it won\'t be an issue this time!\n\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n",2017年2月16日发布,5:24,"11,824 次观看","""196""","""8""",[Conor],[How to Start a Speech],/watch?v=w82a1FT5o88,"10,637,567"

I am a manager with PwC Consulting and the creator of The Career Mastery.  In this video, I will walk you through how to prepare your perfect answer if you stay until the end. Stay tuned. \nEssentially, your starting point should be the job description. \n\nStep 1: Take a look at the job description before going to the interview and find out what skills and experiences they are looking for. This should always be the first step. Always start from what is required, then you can look for a match between what is required and what you have. \nStep 2: Take a look at the skills and experiences that may be required but not necessarily in the job description. I talk about this a lot in many of my videos. There are so many unwritten requirements that only Hiring Managers know. Most of the time, these unwritten requirements are not even in the job description. This happens a lot of the time when HR prepares the job description without consulting with the hiring manager. \nStep 3: Then head over to excel and prepare a list of all those skills and experiences you determined. These should include both written and unwritten requirements.  \nAt Step 4: Go over them and tick those that you think apply to you. \nStep 5: Think of examples from your past. Think deep and come up with at least 2 examples your past employment. It could even be from your education.  \nStep 6: Craft your pitch and practice like crazy.

You can watch it here;  ', '\n\nThis questions can be asked in multiple ways, for example; \n- Why do you want to work here\n- Why do you want to work for us\n- Why do you think you are the best candidate\n- What makes you the perfect fit for this role\n- What makes you the best fit for this role\n\nI am Deniz Sasal, I am a manager with PwC Consulting and the founder of The Career Mastery. In this video, I will share with you two approaches to answering this question. \nThe first approach will be the safe and conventional approach. And then I present you my approach. It’s a bit riskier but if you can pull it off, you will definitely impress them. \n\nAlright, let’s start with the safe, conventional approach.  \nFor this safe approach, you can pick one of the following and build your case around it. \nFor example, general reputation of the company, its leaders, your admiration for its products or services, its success in the market, etc… \n\nThen your answer would be something like this; \nI highly admire your company’s products and I would love to have the opportunity to work in a team which is the best there is. In addition, your reputation for rewarding hard workers is something that really appeals to me. I am confident I will be very successful and this success will further motivate me to deliver extraordinary results. \n\nAlright, this was the safe and conventional approach. Not necessarily something I would say though. \nLet’s now talk about my way. Deniz Sasal’s way. \nThere are essentially 2 scenarios that may apply to you. You are either an experienced I hire, looking to join the firm to solve a particular problem or increase opportunities. Or you have limited experience and joining a well-functioning organization. \nLet’s start with the first one. The experienced hire. So, when they ask you the question of why do you want to work here. You need to do a bit of a misdirection. In this case, you need to sell the problem rather than yourself.  Yes indeed you position yourself as the solution but you focus on the challenges. Then you will mention that those challenges and overcoming them is what motivates you the most. Therefore, you are ready to tackle on whatever challenge they can throw at you. \nWe need an example for this. \nLet’s say you are a digital marketer and interviewing with an SME who is interested in you. They ask you, why do you want to work for us; \nThen you can say something like;\nWhy I want to work with you is highly related with why you want to work with me. Let me explain. I don’t know if you read it but a few weeks ago, Google released a major study on ROI for digital marketing activities. It was very detailed it was a great report. So, the report showed 1 thing that really caught my attention. It said that 96% of small and medium size organizations don’t even break-even in their digital marketing activities. This boils down to one thing. No strategy or bad strategy being implemented. See, large corporates have the budgets to hire world’s biggest digital marketing agencies. But SMEs don’t. They need to make the best use of whatever little budget they have. That’s why I feel like I am fighting for a greater cause here. With my expertise, those SMEs do get their shots at big leagues, and stop wasting their money, increase their outreach, and put their quality products right in front of their audience. And that gives me the biggest satisfaction. Because, I help them beat those larger competitors with a miniscule budget. This impact that I create is the greatest satisfaction I can get. And that’s why I want to work for you. \n\nWhat do you think? I think it’s a very good pitch and I think if you can pull it off in your domain, then you will get thumbs up from the hiring manager. \nNow, let’s look at the other scenario. The other scenario is where you are a fresh graduate or have very limited organization, and you are joining a well-functioning organization. \nIn this scenario, you need some “reasons” . They can be anywhere from their position in the market, their culture, rewarding hardworking employees, their fast growth, etc. \nSo, let’s say you are interviewing for my employer PwC Consulting and you are fresh graduate. I think an ideal answer would be something like this;  \nAlright, here it goes; \n\nFor more resources, visit: ",2016年8月17日发布,4:55,"390,725 次观看","""7,564""","""167""",[Deniz],[What Are Your Weaknesses?

You can watch it here;  ', '\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nThis video also answers the questions of; \nwhat questions to ask in an interview?\nwhat questions to ask at the end of the interview?\nWhat questions to ask the interviewer? \n\nHaving some questions to ask in an interview is essential. Remember at the end of the day it’s a dialogue. Shouldn’t be a monologue. \nYour job is to make them feel that you are the right candidate for the job. You not only possess the right skills but also the experience. \nSo, if you consulted with an HR professional they would advise you that you need to show them that you are interested in the job and that’s why you should just ask your questions to show your enthusiasm. \nThey will advise you that you can ask questions like; \nWhat qualities do your top employers have\nAre there opportunities for further training\nThese are not genuine questions and you should avoid at all cost. You need to look and be genuine. \nSee, all of these questions are fine. But I have a much better approach. One that will definitely increase your chances to get that job.. Stay tuned. \nI am Deniz Sasal, I am a manager with PwC Consulting and the creator of The Career Mastery. \nAlright, now let’s talk about my approach and how I would develop really smart questions to increase my chances.\nThere are essentially 2 scenarios applicable to you. You are either an experienced hire with years of experience or a fresh graduate with limited experience. \nIf you are an experienced hire, then you are obviously joining the firm to add strong values, solve problems, increase opportunities. \nSo, the first question you need to ask yourself is this; \n- What do you know that the hiring managers may unlikely know which would prove your expertise? \nBefore going to the interview, study their business model very well. Understand it inside out, and come up with 1 thing which will open hiring manager’s eyes and realize that you know what you are talking about. He understands that he is not dealing with a hopeful wanna-be. You know your shit. \nLet’s look at an example now. Let’s say you are a management consultant at a director level. You are interviewing with my employer PwC Consulting for government consulting in Dubai. So, in this scenario your question may be; \nOne of my contacts from the government recently informed me that the government is considering a change at Ministry of Cabinet Affairs. It will be called Ministry of Cabinet Affairs and Future. I heard it’s primary mandate is to prepare UAE for post-oil future. This will be quite interesting isn’t it? Are we already positioned to help the ministry? I would love to be part of that team if that’s the case, or the least introduce my contacts at the Cabinet affairs that we can leverage as subject matter experts.  \nI think this is a good example. \nLet me give you another example. This is a real life example actually. My wife just recently interviewed for UberEats for a business development role. Uber Eats if you are not familiar is, Uber’s solution for restaurant deliveries. So, Uber driver’s delivering foods from restaurants to customers. Anyway, the question we prepared for my wife was something like this; \nSee, there are essentially 3 categories of restaurants. Category A is fast foods, Category B is Fine dining. You go to fine dining restaurants not necessarily because of food taste but rather for the ambiance. And Category C is a restaurant with very good food regardless of the ambiance they provide. They may be luxury or very casual. Regardless. So, I believe this is the segment you are targeting. Because otherwise, people wouldn’t pay 15 dollars for delivery of a food item that cost 10 dollars or doesn’t taste great. So, people will use UberEats to access those restaurants with amazing and sometimes rare to find food. Can you let me know if I am correct in my understanding so far? Because if that’s the case, and if my understanding is correct then I will be the perfect fit as most of my network and previous clients belong to this Category C restaurants…\nFor more resources, visit: ",2016年8月16日发布,6:09,"188,449 次观看","""3,849""","""73""",[Deniz],[Top 3 Tough Job Interview Questions And Answers ✓],/watch?v=qig1_YvHJqo,"204,648"

You can watch it here;  ', '\n________________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________________\nWhat are the most difficult interview questions and answers? \n________________________________________________________________\nTo start with, there is no such a thing as a tough interview question. Everything they ask you can be tough or easy depending on your preparation. That’s why it was very difficult for me to prepare this video. \nBut there are a couple of questions that are tricky. So, stay tuned to find out what they are.\n\nI am Deniz Sasal. I am a manager with PwC Consulting and the creator of The Career Mastery. I help unemployed and underemployed find jobs with multinational companies through my blog and my youtube channel. \nAlright let’s continue, right, about the trick questions. The  first tricky question in my mind is What Are Your Weaknesses? \nSee, this is tricky not because HR or the hiring manager are trying trick you into making a mistake. This is very tricky because you, right you, have been misguided so far. So, it’s tricky because you are trying to shoot yourself in the foot and that’s why I wanted to list this question at the top of this list. \nLet me explain further. You are probably thinking that when you are asked about your weaknesses, you should take your greatest strength and then take it to extreme. For example, your greatest weakness is that you are a perfectionist, you don’t delegate as much as you do, you are not great at work life balance, etc. See, this is very dangerous. What you are doing is called “straight up lying”. I need you to understand something, the interviewer is a person. He or She has a functioning brain. Just as how he can spot a bullshit in his personal life he can spot a bullshit in his corporate life. This is additionally important if you are interviewing with a hiring manager.  There were numerous times I heard the classic bullshit answer and was this close to ending the interview. Simply because, I don’t want to work with a liar in my team. I am not a partner at PwC so I don’t have the authority to end interviews like that. But I heard a few stories where partners just kicked the candidates out when the candidates straight up lied or gave bullshit answers. Remember this, if you are interviewing with a successful multinational company, the employees of those firms are pretty smart. And if you are interviewing with a multinational management consulting firm, then you are interviewing with extraordinary talents. People who are pretty much at the top of the food chain when it comes to corporate careers. They don’t deserve to be lied. They gave you an opportunity to present yourself and invested their time, so the least you can do is be honest. If you want to find out what is a good answer, I have a video for it. So, you can click somewhere here and let it open in the new tab. But stick with me because we have 2 more questions to go. \nThe 2nd tough question is I think “Tell me about yourself”. This is also very tricky because you need to present yourself adequately. You need to understand what the requirements are and then present your background accordingly while making it clear that you possess those skills. But here is the tricky bit. The hiring managers ask this question not necessarily to find out whether you possess the right skills or expedrience. After all, they have seen your resume, they may have even googled you. One of the primary reasons they ask this question is to gauge your presentation skills. Imagine if they asked you to present the company, it would be very unfair to you. You don’t know about the company or its services well enough to deliver an impressive presentation. But what better material is there then your very own background to present? Right? This is definitely very important. Companies want employees who can impressively present in front of the clients.So, that’s your opportunity to showcase your presentation skills. I shot a video about this as well. If you want to know how to answer this question in more detail, then click here and open it in the new tab. But again, don’t go yet. We have one more question.\nThe 3rd tough question they may ask you is “Where do you see yourself in 5 years”. \n\n\nFor more resources, visit: ",2016年8月17日发布,5:53,"204,648 次观看","""3,313""","""148""",[Deniz],[What Are Your Weaknesses?

Definitely! \nLong answer is coming up. \n\nSo, the reason I prefer not to give answers to comments asking about a follow up is because I need to first ask a few questions. \nHere are the questions I need you to think about; \n1; who did you interview with?\nWith the HR or Hiring Manager?\n2; what’s the seniority of the role you applied to? \nAre you a junior hire or an experienced hire. \n3; Is being assertive one of the qualities that is desired in the role you interviewed for? \n\nLet’s start with experienced hires. \nIf you interviewed with HR, then please do follow up. Please do it. Then should I call or email. I guess you can start with a nice follow-up email, then if you get no response give them a call. There is no reason for you to be nervous about this. Think of it this way, you spent a significant amount of your time to attend that interview. That was an investment for you. So, the least the HR can do is to keep you posted of the progress. Whether you are selected or rejected, or the decision-making process is still underway. \nIf they say they are still considering various candidates including you and haven’t made the decision yet, then ask for a timeline. That’s ok. When should I expect a decision then? \nWhat are you supposed to do, just sit around and wait for a call when her highness feels like getting back to you?\nI don’t want to be the one bringing bad news to you but if you are interviewing with HR, the odds are that you’ll lose probably lose that opportunity. \n\nLet’s move on, if you however interviewed with the hiring manager, then it’s a completely different ballgame. Now that means you do actually have a pretty good shot at getting that job! A hiring manager will not waste his time interviewing 100s of candidates. It just won’t happen. \n\nFor example, I am a manager with PwC Consulting and there is no way that I will interview more than 5 candidates when we are hiring in our team.

You can watch it here;  ', '\n\nIn this video, I answer a common question ""How To Justify A Gap In Resume or Gap In Employment"". \n\nIn this video, I will talk about whether this is something important that you should be worried about. And how to justify the gap in your employment. \n\nSo, is the gap in your employment really important? The short answer is Yes. In fact, it’s probably more important than you think.\nIt’s, in fact, a major problem. It’s one of those things that just kill so many opportunities before you even know about it. \n\nLet me explain why I had to say that. \n\nSee, in an ideal world Hiring Managers, like myself, wouldn’t really care much about it.  For me it’s all about skills, relevant experience, and character traits. Fairly simple. Even if you have a 2 year gap in your resume, as long as you have enough relevant experience and skills that are still fresh, there is no reason why I would care at all. And this is not just my opinion I know most of my colleagues here at PwC Consulting share the same view with me. \nBut this is what is important; we are hiring managers, we are actual practicing management consultants hiring for the role. We are not HR. \nNow, that’s where the problem is. HR, unfortunately, eliminates a lot of resumes if there is a major gap in the employment record. \n\nThe reasons are two-fold \n1) They want to impress the hiring managers with the profiles they present. Right? So, they don’t want to take a chance on someone who is unemployed and potentially lost all the skills\n\n2) Because you have been unemployed for a long time, they think that you must have attended all these interviews and failed them. So, if you are unemployed for a year, then they think ok you must have had at least 20 interviews and you failed them all. Otherwise, why would you be unemployed? Even if you justify it in your resume somehow, they still most of the time don’t need to take that chance. They actually don’t have to take that chance because your resume is probably 1 in 1,000 resumes received for that role. So, what happen? This is what happens, your resume gets reviewed by the HR and immediately trashed. They won’t have the need to even get in touch  with you to ask “hey why is there such a gap”. Immediately, trashed.  \n\nThen they make an analogy, and consider you as almost unemployable. \n\nSo, what to do then...",2017年3月20日发布,4:23,"115,476 次观看","""3,301""","""141""",[Deniz],[What Are Your Weaknesses?

This is something just very awkward. Why would you even say that. Please don’t. Remember this, it’s a competition. The best candidate wins. Even if all of the candidates deserve to get the job, one of them is a better fit than the others. So, the hiring managers like myself will just choose the best candidate. This doesn’t mean the other candidates aren’t worthy of the role. \nNumber 2: Don’t ask what is the compensation level. It’s too soon. You don’t want to leave an impression that money is your biggest priority. That may just be the case of course understandably.

Sounds like lighting a couple candles (House of Wax), brushing a head of hair (Psycho), stabbing a pumpkin (Halloween), clacking keys on a typewriter (The Shining), rubbing the lotion on her skin (Silence of the Lambs), breaking twigs and branches (The Blair Witch Project), hanging up a phone (Scream), and stirring a spoon in a tea cup (Get Out). \n\n', ""\n\nIn her horror movie Truth or Dare, Lucy Hale will have her hand brutally smashed by a hammer, be stalked by evil forces, and get possessed while having sex, all in the name of one truly haunted game of, yes, Truth or Dare. Scary stuff, right? Well, in fact it was another project that had the 28-year-old actress scared recently—her new television series Life Sentence, which airs on The CW.\n\nIn the show, Hale plays Stella, a young woman who has been living her life under the impression that she is dying from terminal cancer, only to find out, hey, she’s not. \n\nThe premiere of Life Sentence marks Hale’s return to TV just under a year after her immensely popular series Pretty Little Liars ended its 7-year run last summer. \n\nUnlike Pretty Little Liars, where Hale co-headlined with fellow Liars Troian Bellisario, Shay Mitchell, and Ashley Benson, this new show rests firmly on the petite star’s shoulders. \n\nIf anyone knows about the spotlight, it's Hale. Born in Memphis, Hale had her first brush with fame as one of the winners of ABC’s American Idol spinoff, American Juniors, before relocating to Los Angeles at 15 years-old to pursue a career in singing. Hale soon turned her attention to acting, landing guest stints on shows like The O.C., Drake and Josh, and Wizards of Waverly Place, as well as a starring role in the short-lived, but much-beloved WB show Privileged. It was a few short years later that she was cast as Aria Montgomery in Pretty Little Liars, which catapulted her star to a new level thanks to the show’s cult-like following.\n\nRead the full interview here - "", '\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to W on YouTube? ►► ', '\n\nABOUT W\nThe Who, What, Where, When, and Why in the world of fashion and style.

Armed with these interviewing tips you\'ll be ready to go!\n\nFor your convenience here is the transcript of the video:\n\nJEFF\nHi everyone, I\'m Jeff and this is my friend Mike, and together we\'re known as the Interview Guys.  Today we\'re enjoying one of our favorite pastimes...enjoying a cup of coffee and talking about Job Interviews!\n\nMIKE\nJeff, are you sure you didn\'t have one cup of coffee too many?  You seem a little...excited. \n\nJEFF\nI am excited Mike.  But not because of the coffee!  Because A lot of people have been asking us to share our best \ninterview tips, so today we\'ve put together a list of our Top 5 favorites!  If you can master these 5 tips, you\'ll be well \non your way to getting a job offer from your next interview.\n\nMIKE\nAnd pay special attention to tip #5, because it\'s the one tip that\'s really going to set you apart from\nyou competition and get you on offer from your next interview.  So what\'s the first tip on the list Jeff?\n\nJEFF\nTip #1 is that you really need to research the company and the position carefully.  It\'s important to know exactly what they do, who their competitors are, and any current events related to the company.  Take some time to study their website, but make sure you also know the job description inside out.\n\nMIKE\nOur second tip is that you need to practice!  In other words, it\'s important that you prepare perfect answers to some\nof the most commonly asked and toughest interview questions.  How do you do that?  Well hang on to the end of this video and we\'ll show you exactly how.\n\nJEFF\nTip #3 is that you need to prepare a few success stories that you can reference during the interview.  What is a success story?\nA success story is a story from your past, work or personal life, that highlights an achievement and reflects one of your strengths.\n\nMIKE\nTip #4 is a very important one.  You always need to prepare some questions to ask the interviewer.  Why?  Because it shows that you are prepared, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the job.  Not to mention the fact that it will allow you to learn as much as possible about the company and the position you are interviewing for.\n\nJEFF\nAs we said earlier, our final tip is the most important tip on the list.  Tip #5 says that you need to tailor your entire interview to the company you are interviewing with.\n\nMost people walk into the interview room with nowhere near enough knowledge of exactly what the company or organization is looking for. You need to find out before hand exactly what the position calls for in an employee as well as exactly what makes up the company\'s \'perfect candidate"". Once you have this information you can position yourself as that ""perfect candidate"" by giving ""tailored"" interview answers. As we always say: ""it\'s not about you, it\'s about them""\n\nMIKE\nIf that sounds like a lot to take in, don\'t worry!  Because we\'ve prepared a special report that explains Tip  #5 completely and outlines exactly how to prepare perfect answers to every interview question.\n\nJEFF\nThat\'s right.

The SOLID acronym was first introduced by Michael Feathers\n\nSOLID Acronym \nS : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) \nO : Open closed Principle (OSP) \nL :  Liskov substitution Principle (LSP) \nI  :  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) \nD : Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n\nSingle Responsibility Principle \n1. Robert C. Martin expresses the principle as, ""A class should have only one reason to change”\n2.Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class\n\nLiskov Substitution Principle \n1. Introduced by Barbara Liskov state that “objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of that program”\n2. If a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module\n3. We can also state that Derived types must be substitutable for their base types\n\nOpen/Closed Principle \n1. “Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification”\n2. The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changes in the existing code \n3. The design should be done in a way to allow the adding of new functionality as new classes, keeping as much as possible existing code unchanged\n\nInterface Segregation Principle \n1. “Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface”\n2.We should not enforce clients to implement interfaces that they don\'t use. Instead of creating one big interface we can break down it to smaller interfaces\n\nDependency Inversion Principle \n1. One should “depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions""\n2. Abstractions should not depend on the details whereas the details should depend on abstractions\n3. High-level modules should not depend on low level modules \n\nIf we don’t follow SOLID Principles we  \n1. End up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications\n2. Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirement, features or any bug fixes and some times it creates unknown issues\n3. End up with a code which is not testable\n4. End up with duplication of code\n5. End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug\n6. End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle\n\nFollowing SOLID Principles helps us to  \n1. Achieve reduction in complexity of code\n2. Increase readability, extensibility and maintenance\n3. Reduce error and implement Reusability\n4. Achieve Better testability\n5. Reduce tight coupling\n\nSolution to develop a successful application depends on  \nArchitecture : choosing an architecture is the first step in designing application based on the requirements. Example : MVC, WEBAPI, MVVM..etc\nDesign Principles : Application development process need to follow the design principles\nDesign Patterns : We need to choose correct design patterns to build the software\n\nIf you are confused on how we can apply these design principles in the application development? Don’t worry as we are going to take a look at them in greater details in the upcoming videos.\n\nIn the next video we will discuss single responsibility principle in detail with a sample example.\n\nText version of the video\n', '\n\nSlides\n', '\n\nSOLID Design Principles Tutorial\n', '\n\nSOLID Design Principles Text Articles & Slides\n', '\n\nAll Dot Net and SQL Server Tutorials in English\n', '\n\nAll Dot Net and SQL Server Tutorials in Arabic\n",2017年11月20日发布,6:14,"156,669 次观看","""685""","""65""","[kudvenkat, kudvenkat, Tech, NorfolkDevelopers, Tech, Coding, TDD, Microsoft, Christopher, Patrick, .NET, Christopher, StreamACon, .NET, BBarters, .NET, BBarters, IAmTimCorey, edutechional]","[Single Responsibility Principle, Part 3   Why and when should we use an abstract class, Six Most Used Design Patterns in Project, The Principles of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob Martin, How to Design Microservices Architecture?

Size of the variable and format in the memory is decided based on the data type.\n\n2. C# language is called as type safe as the compiler validates an expression whether correct or not based on the data type.\n\n3. Going forward a trainee will understand the following topics in depth:\na. Global Memory\nb. Stack Memory\nc. Heap Memory\n\n4. Value type directly holds the value. Ex: All Basic Types, Structures & Enum and memory allocation is done either on Global, Stack or Heap based on the scope of the variable.\n\n5. Reference type holds the reference to the value. Ex: array, class etc and memory allocation is done on HEAP.\n\nMr. Sandeep Soni is a Microsoft Certified Trainer (MCT), MCSD, MCPD and has over 18+ years of experience in teaching technologies, Sandeep has trained over 1,00,000 students across the globe, and has been appreciated and recognized by many corporate for the technology training delivered onsite.
